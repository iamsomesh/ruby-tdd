# RSpec - Testing Framework

RSpec is a testing framework for Ruby. It provides a domain-specific language (DSL) for writing tests in a readable and expressive manner. In the code you provided, `RSpec` is the module that contains the functionality for defining and running tests.

By using RSpec in your code, you can write test cases to verify the behavior of your Ruby code. These tests help ensure that your code functions correctly and behaves as expected in different scenarios. RSpec provides a set of methods and macros that allow you to define test suites, describe the behavior of your code, and make assertions about the expected outcomes.
